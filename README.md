# This program is an alarm clock / timer
## Implement with: node timer1.js (time1) (time2) ... 
## Will *beep* at (time1), (time2), ...
# My WSL's definition of beep is completely silent so as a placeholder I have output a string. 
# I would have installed a package to implement a beep but that a visible character was said to be fine.
